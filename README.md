CAH-Server
===============================
This is a school project for the development of a server interface for the card game "Cards against Humanity"

It's build on top of the [Yii 2-Framework](http://www.yiiframework.com/). We used the [Advanced-Template](https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2-app-advanced) so look there for the missing *-local.php config file examples. They are needed for the database connection!
